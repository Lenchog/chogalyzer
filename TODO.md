# Stuff i have to do  
write function for trying all of the algs 
make nice graphs
add column swapping to pure hill climbing
## add variants of combinations of algorithms 
- sim annealing then put all threads onto climbing the best hill
- simultaneous sim annealing then hill climb all layouts
- somewhere between those 2 (choose 2 best layouts then climb those hills with 8 threads each)

# optimisation stuff
Bigram caching (maybe trigram)
    Cache key comboes, persists through different layouts (op??)
Read small corpus then do big one (gotta get small corpus first)
Cached swaps maybe

# Not important stuff
fingermap (chog will make it easy)
configuration
